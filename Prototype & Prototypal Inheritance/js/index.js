/*
Whenever we create any js object, function or variable, they get access of
to some of the hidden properties and methods.  All these comes via Prototype.

Functions are also somewhat object.

And all these hidden properties and methods can be accessed with dot operator

Prototype - Whenever you create an Object, Js engine automatically put this hidden properties into an 
object and attached to your Object.

__proto__ - This is the Object where JS engine puts all the hidden properties and methods that are attached into
our defined Object.
